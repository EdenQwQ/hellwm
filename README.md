# HellWM Wayland Compositor

## "The HellWM is this ?"

HellWM is meant to be light and **modular** Wayland Compositor with features.
Still in **very** early development, currently unusable for daily use.
I'm open for contributions and ideas that will make this project better.

## Features:
- [ ] tiling
- [ ] xdg-shell 
- [ ] workspaces
- [ ] wlr-layer-shell

- [ ] xwayland
- [ ] lua integration (that's why **modular**)
