# HellWM Wayland Compositor

## The hell is HellWM?

HellWM is meant to be very light and modular Wayland Compositor with some unique features, like **binary workspace** or **config hot reload**.
Still under development, open for contributions and ideas that will make this project better.

## TODO:
- [ ] xwayland

## DONE:
- [x] config
- [x] workspaces
- [x] wlr-layer-shell
- [x] binary workspaces
- [x] tiling (kinda?, **TODO**: rewrite using nodes.)
