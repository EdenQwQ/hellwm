# HellWM

## "The HellWM is this ?"

HellWM is meant to be light and modular Wayland Compositor with features - will see how it goes:)

I'm open for contributions and ideas that will make this project better.

IMPORTANT to do: 
- [ ] ! TILING
- [ ] ! wlr-layer-shell 
- [ ] ! xdg-shell 
- [ ] ! xwayland 
- [ ] ! hot reload config (and just config)
- [ ] ! it's wm so workspaces feature :)

In future TO DO:
- animations
- layouts for tiling
- smart plugin system
- 'rdp' like plugin for compatibility with other workspaces such as PC + laptop
- communication system with CTL like hellwm helper (hellwm with scripts etc.)
