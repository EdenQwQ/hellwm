# hellwm
The HellWM is this ?

HellWM is meant to be light and modular Wayland Compositor with features - will see how it goes:)

Currently it's just base from tinywl, because Im trying to realy understand how it works.

It's not usable window manager YET.

NOW to do: 
- [  ]! TILING
- [ ] ! wlr-layer-shell working
- [ ] ! xdg-shell working
- [ ] ! Xwayland working
- [ ] ! hot reload config
- [ ] ! it's wm so workspaces feature :) 

In future TO DO:
- animations
- layouts for tiling
- smart plugin system
- own 'rdp' as a plugin
- communication system (hellwm with scripts etc.)
