# HellWM Wayland Compositor

## "The HellWM is this ?"

HellWM is meant to be light and modular Wayland Compositor with features - still in early development.

I'm open for contributions and ideas that will make this project better.

## IMPORTANT to do: 
- [x] xdg-shell 
- [x] config (now only keybinds, lua and full control over WM soon)
- [ ] FULL lua integration 
- [ ] TILING
- [ ] wlr-layer-shell (almost)
- [ ] xwayland
- [ ] it's wm so workspaces feature :)

## In future TO DO:
- animations
- layouts for tiling
- smart plugin system
- 'rdp' like plugin for compatibility with other workspaces such as PC + laptop
- communication system with compositor (inspiration from hyprctl)
